# Welcome CUCyber
We are Columbia University's only cybersecurity oriented student-led organization. Our mission is to educate the Columbia community in topics of information and cyber security, bridge the gap between classroom theory and real-world application and connect students with potential future employers.
This repository holds all materials, demos, presentations that will be used in meetings for educational purposes as well as guides on basic skills. Please use these materials responsibly.

### Fall 2021 Meeting Schedule:
Thursdays 7pm-8:30pm EST usually in the CS Lounge
